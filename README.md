### cachesim

This code is from a unfinished project that was to study multi-level caching impact
in a deep storage hierarchy, e.g., memory and SSD cache.
cachesim includes implementation of the following well-known caching algorithms:

* 2q
* arc
* fifo
* lfu
* lirs
* lrfu
* lru
* opt
* random

cachesim also integrates the [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/) discrete event simulator.
